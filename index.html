			Flying
		</h2>
		<p>
			<font size="4">
				One of my more recent hobbies has become flying. I am training to become a pilot and get my Private Pilot's License. I want to try and be able to fly many different kinds of planes from  single engine Cherokee 140s to a Boeing 747.
				I just enjoy the feeling of lying in the air and being able to fly an airplane. I currently at 8 hours in the air and I enjoy every minute of it. Even still it requires a lot of rigorous, filled with many long hard hours to become a pilot.
